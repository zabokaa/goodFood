## Objective

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to add a new food entry so that I can keep track of what I eat and how it makes me feel.

- As a user, I want to see the average feeling of a type of food I ate so that I can understand how different foods affect my mood and well-being.

- - As a user, I want to delete a food entry so that I can correct mistakes or remove entries that are no longer relevant.

- As a user, I want to search for food entries by date so that I can review what I ate and how I felt on a specific day.

- As a user, I want to exit the application so that I can end my session when I'm done using the food tracker.

- As a user, I want to see messages printed with a frame so that important information stands out in the console output.

- As a user, I want to interact with a menu so that I can easily choose the operation I want to perform.

- As a user, I want to see validation messages when I enter invalid input so that I can correct my mistakes and learn how to use the application correctly.

- As a user, I want to see a table of search results so that I can easily understand and review the data.

- As a user, I want to interact with a Google Sheets document so that my food entries are saved and can be accessed and analyzed later.
